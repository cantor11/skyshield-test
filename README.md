### Introduction
This project aims to develop a collaborative and interactive 3D web page designed to raise awareness and educate users about environmental issues related to air. Through an immersive experience, users will learn about the causes, impacts, and solutions to problems such as the: 
- Greenhouse effect
- Ozone layer depletion
- Smog

### Terminology and Features

1. Homepage:
- General introduction to air-related environmental issues.
- Interactive navigation to explore each issue in an immersive manner.
- Summary of environmental problems with links to detailed sections that explore causes, impacts, and solutions through visuals.

2. Environmental Issues Section 
- Each issue (greenhouse effect, ozone depletion, smog) is presented immersively, including:
  - Introduction to the Issue: Clear explanation of the environmental problem and its context.
  - Awareness: Visual elements and graphics to help understand the impact of the problem.
  - Solutions: Practical proposals with simulations illustrating how to implement them.

3. User Management:
- User management is implemented with cloud storage, allowing users to save their quiz progress, scores, and virtual rewards.

4. 3D Interactive Quiz:
- Interactive situations representing environmental issues.
- Instant feedback on answers.
- Scores and virtual rewards that motivate continuous learning.
